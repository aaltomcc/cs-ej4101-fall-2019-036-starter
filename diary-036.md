# Reasons for taking this course

I took this course because I wanted to know what is behind the word DevOps that has been around for a while and how does it 
affect software development. In addition, as I knew it was related to software processes, I wanted to learn how modern 
software processes are managed. Also, I wanted to get a full grip on the ideology behind DevOps, as I was interested to think 
if such culture could be applied in other industries as well. Moreover, I wanted to learn about the 
different tools used in DevOps and how they relate to each other. I was expected to learn the motivation and benefits behind 
the methodology, as I was suspicious if the benefits outweighed the workload of setting up a toolchain.

# Things I learned

* CAMS stands for Culture, Automation, Measurement and Sharing, and the model describes the principles of the DevOps 
movement. I think all these enable the organization to focus on developing things (and people) rather than fixing things.

* Removing the barrier between development and operations requires co-operation and common language between the teams but brings
significant benefits through time and money savings. 

* I learned the relevant concepts of continuous development, testing, integration, deployment and delivery and how they are 
related to each other. The full process is managed through a toolchain that contains dedicated software tools for each part.

* I think most benefit is achieved by removing human labor in the chain, i.e. through automation. Especially automated 
testing and integration speeds up the development loop, since most of the bugs are (and should be) found before deployment. 
Before setting up continuous delivery, the organization should be confident that the previous steps are good enough, so that 
the testing section does not end up being outsourcesd to the user / customer.

* I finally got a reason to learn how to use git and GitHub, as I previously had not a real need to do that. I did not know 
how versatile the system was prior to the course, and it was also nice to learn how to use GitHub Pages as well. Also, it was 
interesting to see how the continuous delivery approach can be applied even to simple web pages.
