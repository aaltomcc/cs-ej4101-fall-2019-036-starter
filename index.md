# About the Suspension Monorail in Wuppertal

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuppertal_Schwebebahn): The Wuppertaler Schwebebahn (Wuppertal Suspension Railway) is a suspension railway in Wuppertal, Germany. Its full name is 
Anlage einer elektrischen Hochbahn (Schwebebahn), System Eugen Langen. It is the oldest electric elevated railway with 
hanging cars in the world and is a unique system.

Designed by Eugen Langen to sell to the city of Berlin, the installation with elevated stations was built in Barmen, 
Elberfeld and Vohwinkel between 1897 and 1903; the first track opened in 1901. The Schwebebahn is still in use today as a 
normal means of local public transport, moving 25 million passengers annually (2008).
